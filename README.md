# warmup learning
 I learn Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers manage code changes, coordinate work, and maintain high standards in collaborative environments.
i Understand the core workflow: git init (start repo), git add (stage changes), git commit (save snapshot), git status (track changes), git log (see history), git push (upload changes), git pull (download updates), and git merge (combine branches).​
                 Practice with local repositories and basic commands to gain confidence.
Learn to use branches for isolating work: git branch (create/manage), git checkout (switch), git merge (integrate changes).
Feature/ branches : Used for creating new features or tackling specific tasks. These are branched off from dev, worked on in isolation, then merged back once completed.Platforms like GitHub enhance Git with Pull/Merge Requests, peer review workflows, and additional security for collaborative code changes.
